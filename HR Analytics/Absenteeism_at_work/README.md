# Absenteeism at Work Analysis üè¢

Welcome to the Absenteeism at Work project! Here, I've analyzed patterns of absenteeism among employees in the workplace, investigating the reasons behind their time off. Let's delve into the data to uncover insights that can help improve workplace attendance.

## TL;DR

- **Objective**: Analyze absenteeism at work and identify factors contributing to employee absences.
- **Tools Used**: SQL for data preprocessing and querying, Excel for analysis and manipulation, Power BI for creating interactive dashboards.
- **Key Findings**: Trends, patterns, and potential solutions for reducing absenteeism.
- **Project Structure**: Raw data files, SQL queries, Excel workbook, Power BI dashboard

## Aim

This project aims to analyze absenteeism at work and identify factors contributing to employee absences. By leveraging SQL, Excel, and Power BI, I explore the dataset to understand trends, patterns, and potential solutions for reducing absenteeism.

## Data Source

The data for this project is sourced from [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/445/absenteeism+at+work), containing records of employee absences along with reasons, duration, and other relevant information.

## Analysis Overview

In this project, I've:

- Utilized SQL for data preprocessing and querying to extract relevant insights.
- Employed Excel for data analysis and manipulation, performing calculations and generating summary statistics.
- Created interactive dashboards and visualizations using Power BI to present findings and trends effectively.
