# COVID-19: Tracking the COVID-19 Pandemic ðŸ¦ 
Welcome to The COVID-19 Project, your one-stop destination for tracking the COVID-19 pandemic across the globe. In this project, I've curated and analyzed data on COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations, providing insights into the ever-evolving situation.

## TL;DR

- **Objective**: Analyze COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations across countries.
- **Data Source**:  [Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)  
- **Key Findings**: Total cases, deaths, recoveries, daily new cases, vaccination rates, and regional trends.
- **Project Structure**: Raw data files, SQL scripts, visualizations.

## Overview
This project aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the COVID-19 pandemic since its inception. By leveraging data from reliable sources, including government agencies and health organizations, I've created visualizations and analyses to help you understand the trajectory of the virus and its impact on different countries.

## Aim

This project aims to showcase my data exploration and visualization skills. By analyzing COVID-19 data, I demonstrate my ability to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets and communicate them effectively through visualizations.
