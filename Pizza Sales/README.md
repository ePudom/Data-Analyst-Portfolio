# Pizza Sales Analysis üçï

Welcome to the Pizza Sales Analysis project! Here, I embark on a flavorful journey into the realm of pizza sales, exploring the intricate dynamics of customer preferences, ordering trends, and sales patterns for a fictional pizza store. Through meticulous analysis and insightful observations, I aim to uncover hidden gems within the data that can inform strategic decisions and elevate the pizza-selling experience.

## TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read)

- **Objective**: Uncover insights from pizza sales data to inform strategic decisions and enhance customer satisfaction.
- **Approach**: Utilize SQL for data preprocessing and Excel for in-depth analysis and visualization.
- **Key Insights**: Customer preferences, daily and hourly trends, ordering patterns, and market dynamics.
- **Project Structure**: Organized repository with raw data, SQL queries, Excel analysis, and README.md.

## Aim

The primary objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of pizza sales data, delving deep into the nuances of customer behavior and market trends.

## Data Source

The data used in this project is [Pizza Place Sales](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mysarahmadbhat/pizza-place-sales) which was gotten from Kaggle, encompassing variables such as order details, pizza categories and size. This dataset serves as the cornerstone of my analysis, providing a fertile ground for exploration and discovery.

## Analysis Overview

In my quest for insights, I employ a multifaceted approach that harnesses the power of both SQL and Excel. 

### SQL Exploration 
I kickstart my journey with SQL to explore, preprocess and wrangle the raw data into a format conducive to analysis. Through a series of intricate queries, I sift through the data, unraveling intricate patterns and extracting nuggets of wisdom hidden within.

### Excel Analysis
With my data primed and ready, I transition to Excel, where I embark on a voyage of discovery, armed with pivot tables, charts, and formulas. Here, I delve into the finer details of customer preferences, dissecting popular toppings, dissecting peak ordering times, and uncovering emerging trends that illuminate the path to pizza-selling success.
